               IDEAS TO REDUCE IMPACT OF NATURAL DISASTER

We all know that natural disasters are something which can't be stopped ,only their impact can be reduced. 
 
Below is explanation of ways in which our appliction might be helpful in reducing impact of  natural disasters:

1) Main idea of our application is to use mobile IMEI number to reduce impact of natural disasters:
   
   Our application will save mobile IMEI number of user as soon as user downloads our application and update it in a    central database.Our application will also store data of user location based on GPS till its possible.A lost/stolen   mobile's location can be easily traced from its IMEI number as soon as mobile is switched ON.So main advantage   of using IMEI number for tracing location is that  mobile location can be detected even when mobile don't have any     active internet connection or even if there is no network to send S.M.S.Therefore during any natural disaster our        applictaion will prepare database of all stored IMEI numbers in disaster prone area(based on their last traced   location through mobile GPS) .a list of IMEI number will be prepared on central server then loction of those IMEI    number in list will be detected and then a dynamic list  of location  and IMEI number will be prepared in which high    pirority will be given to those people who are trapped in highly prone area as compared to lesser prone area , then    an help conformation SMS will be sent to them asking whether they want rescue team to rescue them or they are   safe.if they reply that they want help then their current location will be given to rescue forces for immediate help.

2)Other main idea of our application is to prepare information about disaster prone areas and all major and minor    natural disaster happened  in past, and provide these information to users. Also in case of  possibility of a near    natural disaster in user area it will constantly warn user and store all emergency numbers on user mobile.
   Also during any possible natural disaster in near future appilcation will ask user to recommend application to his    friends and relatives so that more and more number of people can be detected during natural disaster.

3)Other main idea of our application is that it will provide all safety measures that an individual can do to remain      safe during any natural disaster.

4)Other main idea is that we will try to host prize based quizzes in association with disaster management                          authority of local governments, and these quizzes will be based on ways in which we can reduce impact of    possible natural disasters,so that more and more people will become aware about disaster management by     actively participating due to prizes.
